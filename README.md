# HNSTrackPack
This is a repository containing my terrible trackpack for the MKWii Hide and Seek Mod.

## More info
This is a package of generally terrible tracks (at least for hns) packaged for use with the Mario Kart Wii - Hide and Seek Mod.
It is intended to be placed in the <sd_root>/hns/mystuff/ directory.

## Hide and Seek?
You can get the mod here: https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Hide_and_Seek.

## What tracks are included?
You can take a look at the tracklist.txt file, or load up the game and find out!
(A MenuSingle_E/U.szs has been included).

## Where can I find more tracks, find out who made these ones?
Check out https://wiki.tockdom.com for more tracks and other MKWii mods.
To find out who made the tracks, for now just search them on the wiki.

### I have a suggestion...
Please make a pull request to the community branch, following the instructions contained in ./Tracklist/CommunitySuggestion.txt

### How do I use this
Download the latest release. You can then use the pack as a mystuff with another distribution, or as a standalone riivolution pack.
It is of course, intended for the Hide and Seek mod.

# Special Thanks
